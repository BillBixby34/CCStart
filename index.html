              <h3>Katie Kenlan</h3>
              <p>I'm 16 and a junior at Chapel Hill High School. I've lived in this area my whole life. I've been part of the YMCA Leaders Club for 3 years and have volunteered at their after school programs and day camps, which are always really fun!
                They do a trainings on working with kids so we can give them a safe and happy experience. I also do volunteering through them and volunteer at the animal shelter.  At school, Iâ€™m one of the captains of the track team and leaders of the book club. I love to read, run, mountain bike, and paint. When I was younger I loved going to outdoorsy camps like this, so I'm really excited!</p>

            <h3>Sofia Nyiri</h3>
            <p>I'm currently a junior at Chapel Hill High School. Over the summer I worked at Morningside summer camp where I supervised children of all ages. Some activities we did were arts and crafts or we went on adventures to Bolin Creek!
              With my past experience at summer camps, I know how to have fun while staying safe! I used to have my own summer camp during the summer of 2020 where I watched 3 elementary school kids. I created the program and activities for them, while staying covid safe! Along with that, I have a 9 year old brother who I babysit all the time. I love to be involved with our community, whether it's volunteering or helping local campaigns. Some of my other hobbies include reading, making jewelry, and playing piano!</p>

              <p>Ebony Terry Flores grew up in the rural community of Pittsboro, NC. She was a frequent explorer of the creeks and the damn around the Haw River and Jordan Lake. After attending UNC Pembroke she studied among naval ships and submarines and volunteered with youth football and cheer teams.  She is a long-time friend of the director of Carolina Creek Club, Katie Kenlan, and a downright southern girl.</p>

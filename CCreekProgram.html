              <p id="test-color">Creek Club programs are for 5- to 12-year-olds. Younger children may be accepted on a case-by-case basis. Activities each week vary and are weather dependent, but include water quality investigations, stream stewardship skills, plant identification, games, and lots of physical activity. We will be outside exclusively.  After you register drop off instructions, what to bring and camp procedures will be sent in an email.<br>
                <br>
                When any child arrives at Creek Club for their first day we start our day by circling up, going over safety rules, and playing a get-to-know you game. Each day we talk about what kind of activities or areas of the creek and trails kids want to explore. While this is a child-led program and kids help decide what kinds of activities and areas of the woods they want to visit, teachers incorporate plant ID, stream stewardship knowledge, and cooperative group building and socioemotional skills into the day. We talk about how it’s more fun to explore and find beautiful places and things when the people around you are thoughtful and kind. We also focus on observation and using our senses in order to find and observe details in nature we may otherwise have walked right past.

              <b><u>A note on shoes:</u></b> Rainboots and water shoes are very useful. If kids do not have these or don’t want to wear them, an old pair of shoes is best to wear. We usually get our feet wet and muddy. In colder months kids are required to bring a second pair of shoes in case feet get wet.  Otherwise they will need to be picked up early due to safety concerns. Clothing lists and recommendations of shoes and clothes are provided as the seasons change.
              <br><br>
              <b><u>Weather: </u><br>
                We have camp in all weather. Creek Club is canceled in extreme weather conditions such as thunder and lightning, torrential rain, or flash flood warnings.  It's sometimes possible to adjust the start time of camp in these instances. This is usually done through a group text. In most instances, however, we cancel camp for the day. There's no refund for days canceled due to the weather. Make-up days will be offered for the Afterschool program depending on the group’s availability to come on a non-regularly scheduled day. 
                Teacher Workday day programs are refunded if they are canceled due to weather or a credit is offered.

              <b>Future offering: Preschooler Age Once a week Day program</b>
              <br>
              Our Director Katie Kenlan was a preschool teacher at The Morningside School for over 5 years and has a wealth of experience with preschools and outdoor exploring. She has an interest in offering a once a weekday program to 5-and-unders in a small group for 3- to 4-hour sessions. Groups would be made up of 3-5 children, depending on the ages of the children. Time of day would depend on the preferences of parents.
              <br>
              Please email <a style=color:#071715 href="mailto:carolinacreekclub@gmail.com">CarolinaCreekClub@gmail.com</a> if you are interested.The program would be once a week day program. Sign up would be for month long semester. Groups would be made up of 3-5 children depending on ages of children.
